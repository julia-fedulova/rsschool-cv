# Fedulova Julia

Hardworking and enthusiastic, I am interested in IT and everything in its sphere. I recently began to be fascinated by web programming, e.g. developing apps and building websites. I want to gain more experience in the field of IT and Frontend-development. My main skill is the ability to quickly learn new things and adapt to modern requirements.
